1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,920
So.

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,160
So, friends, I greet you all.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,160
In general, I'm not on the air right

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,640
now.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,770
I will now try to do a series of tarot

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,430
card lessons. As you can see, we are in the

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,730
format, well, like

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,380
a lifestyle. I decided not to bother with

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,460
setting up a video camera, or something else.......

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,110
Subsequently, you will see this broadcast.

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,530
Today there will be a lesson on tarot cards. I'll

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,429
tell you how I use it myself, how

13
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,589
I get information. This will probably be a

14
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:55,160
lengthy conversation.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,989
I will stumble, maybe make

16
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,300
some grammatical mistakes. Sorry,

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,489
I don't have much time. It will be

18
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,090
such a broadcast, a closed broadcast, which

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,120
you will see later and surely write

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,130
your comments

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,240
and some interesting messages. I also want

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,210
to say that broadcasts on this YouTube

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,130
channel are extremely rare.

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,140
Mostly private broadcasts. This is my

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,420
second YouTube channel called

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,640
"metasensitive". The first channel is called

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,740
"Meta Senses". Therefore, if you come across this

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,670
YouTube channel, then you

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,350
can see me on my second YouTube channel

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,390
called "Meta Senses", where we talk, also

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,479
communicate, I also conduct broadcasts,

32
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,360
broadcasts, everything

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,090
else.

34
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,829
Before I start, I would also like to ask

35
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,969
you for support, because such topics,

36
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,780
as a rule, are not

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,150
supported by our society, and, as

38
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,159
a rule, your comments, your likes, probably

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,170
donations, which happens extremely

40
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,320
rarely, will inspire the next  series

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,369
so that you can see and learn

42
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,760
more about this world.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
A magical, magical world in which we

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,330
live.

45
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,069
Before I start talking, I

46
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,069
want to say....... well, like, to give

47
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,480
such basic knowledge

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,700
about how it works in general,

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,239
how it works.

50
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,660
What my practice shows me, in principle,

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,030
and numerology,

52
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,590
and tarot cards, and in general,

53
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,840
obtaining any information works according

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,050
to the same scheme.

55
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,260
We live in the space of a

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,390
certain information field, in which everything

57
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,319
is already prescribed in one way or another.

58
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,180
As I said, according to the "metasensitive"

59
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,030
system, I explained how I explain it,

60
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,000
why everything is prescribed, and why we still

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,370
have some choice of where to go, where not

62
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,340
to go, and so on, and so on....... Well, in a nutshell,

63
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,010
so as not to dive deeply into this and

64
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,950
not to devote a whole stream to this topic,

65
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,230
I want to say that, in principle, we

66
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,350
remember ourselves. This information will be

67
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,079
enough for you to understand everything.

68
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,150
That is, you are as a person who wakes up, and

69
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,660
it depends on you how powerfully you

70
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,030
will wake up in your awareness, how powerfully

71
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,890
you will understand what is happening

72
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,440
to you. Because what happens to

73
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,440
you, everything goes according to the same

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,600
scenario. But how you feel this

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,760
scenario, how you interpret

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,079
for yourself the events that happen

77
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,299
to you, it depends on you. That is,

78
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,549
it is your choice - how to

79
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,560
perceive, how to feel, how to interpret

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,519
certain events. As you know,

81
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,160
you've already had this in your life, when

82
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
some events that seemed negative

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,659
to you were subsequently

84
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,000
interpreted by

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,379
you as quite positive, very positive.

86
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,500
Therefore, it all depends on your

87
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,269
feelings and on your

88
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,979
interpretation - how you feel, how you perceive.

89
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,690
Working, for example, with tarot

90
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,810
cards and getting insights on tarot

91
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,190
cards is also an interpretation,

92
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,380
but of a more specific nature. That is,

93
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,050
for example, you can interpret

94
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,650
some events that

95
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,130
the cards will show you

96
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,860
as negative events.

97
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,570
Let's say the Tower of Destruction, or something

98
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,539
else. But later you will see that you

99
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,650
still have a choice of how to feel

100
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,050
life, how to enter into interaction

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,970
with it. Therefore,

102
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,690
the cards are not some kind of guillotine

103
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,580
that says: "Well, you have negative events there" or

104
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,400
something else. I want to give you an example

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,590
of my life: when I was doing a real

106
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,530
estate business, and before buying

107
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,700
real estate for rent

108
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,960
(it was and is in the hotel) , I asked the

109
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,860
cards what would happen, whether there

110
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,080
would be a positive moment or not, and I

111
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,970
constantly

112
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,700
got a Queen of Swords in my spread.

113
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,580
In principle, there is nothing good about it.

114
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,470
In most cases, this is

115
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,220
interpreted as such an enemy, moreover,

116
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,550
an intellectual, on the edge of a knife,

117
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,330
who will fight with you, with whom you can

118
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,280
enter into some kind of conflicts.

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,800
Indeed, when we bought it, and I arrived for

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,650
the first time, and we warned that we were

121
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,719
coming, it turned out that the

122
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,360
rooms that we bought were occupied by

123
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,880
guests. That is, a buyer arrives, and the

124
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,000
manager of this hotel has

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,370
already rented out these rooms, and we cannot

126
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,159
even look at them. And we got into a

127
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,349
conflict, said "evict", "relocate" and

128
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:10,870
so on. Subsequently, the same woman, the

129
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,120
same manager, imposed a contract with the hotel

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,760
on us, and for three months we were losing money

131
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
because she rented from the

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,740
hotel until we took control of everything.

133
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,580
But later this same woman was some kind

134
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,190
of angel, when we found some kind of contact

135
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,200
with her, and suddenly this

136
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,170
Queen of Swords, about whom these cards

137
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,330
were talking,

138
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,800
turned into the person who began to help

139
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
us with our real estate,

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,730
and due to this person, we manage to

141
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,790
rent it out remotely, that

142
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,470
is, without being present,

143
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,010
without controlling it ourselves.

144
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,880
That is, you know, even a person

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,650
who shows up as an enemy at the first

146
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,050
stage, you can subsequently find some

147
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,950
contacts with her and, most interestingly,

148
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,650
according to her position,

149
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,900
she must

150
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,840
do some things, help those who are owners do

151
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,330
things, but she

152
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,820
does not do this at all,

153
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,040
and many faced big, big problems, those who later

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,230
entered this hotel business, this hotel

155
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,140
system. She is with them in tough conflicts.

156
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,830
And we have picked up some keys, and

157
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,440
always, so far at

158
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,100
this moment, she helps. I gave you

159
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,110
an example that not everything is so

160
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,200
simple, and, again, you control

161
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,570
some events, even when events, for

162
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,210
example, are some kind of negative,

163
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,580
you can

164
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,490
still find some keys, some options

165
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,180
how to interact with it.

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,120
Another thing I would like

167
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,270
to say: we will use Waite's tarot

168
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,590
cards. The usual tarot

169
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,900
card, which is used by very, very many,

170
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,780
and I myself recommend, because these are

171
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,060
simple images. Even from the picture,

172
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,930
it is already clear what it is about.

173
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,480
Many people are

174
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,220
asking, but what

175
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,888
if, say, use Aleister

176
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,580
Crowley's tarot?

177
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:25,479
That is, Aleister Crowley's cards.

178
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,319
Is this good or is it bad?

179
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,080
Is it possible to? Crowley was a magician

180
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,649
of the highest level.

181
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,849
That is, if you will learn using his deck of

182
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,950
cards, then you will face the fact

183
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,459
that there is a deeper interpretation

184
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,470
of energies, levels and everything

185
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,080
else. That is, this is a deeper analysis,

186
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,080
and you will understand that this analysis is

187
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,420
not always necessary for you. That is, you

188
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,270
should understand that when

189
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,290
people came to Aleister

190
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,010
Crowley and asked

191
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,470
him about their life, then

192
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,470
these people, as a rule, paid

193
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,279
big, big money, and

194
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,770
he literally did a

195
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,810
deeper analysis. That is, people understood that you would

196
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,940
not come to him a second time, you would not come a third time.

197
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,010
Moreover, Aleister Crowley was constantly

198
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,290
moving, he constantly traveled,

199
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,230
he lived all the time in some hotels,

200
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,310
that is, you need

201
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,370
to understand why you use such a powerful

202
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,770
weapon if you want to

203
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,170
use something in everyday life, or

204
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,630
if you  are you guided by the fact that some

205
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,700
people will come to you, then come back, ask you

206
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,149
about something? But Aleister

207
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,420
Crowley's cards are when analysis

208
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,399
is done

209
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,490
once in a lifetime, analysis

210
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,829
down to the smallest

211
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,510
details, some energetic moments. That is,

212
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,700
you have to understand. Therefore, it is not

213
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,610
necessary to shoot at flies with a cannon. This is your

214
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,649
first piece of advice. So the simpler the

215
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,230
better

216
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,060
for beginners, non-beginners,

217
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,029
depending on what you use it for.

218
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,649
The next point I would like to say is that

219
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,860
the cards are alive, and when you enter

220
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,690
a certain stream, then you must understand for

221
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,829
yourself that this is

222
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,020
a living structure, and

223
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,890
the cards will begin to communicate with you.

224
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,380
There are certain cards that you can

225
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,440
understand exactly how they are reflected

226
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,000
in your life, only when faced

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,620
with real situations in

228
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,140
your life. That is, let's say some card

229
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,680
falls out like the Chariot of Hermes.

230
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,110
You can read the meaning of this

231
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,660
card, but this card will interact

232
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,600
in your stream in a certain way.

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,210
That is, you just need to trace how

234
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,200
this card works in your particular life.

235
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,270
Therefore, when you start working

236
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,670
with a tool like tarot cards, you

237
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:09,521
must learn from life,

238
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:11,230
that is, enter the flow.

239
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,850
You must, of course, understand some basic

240
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,120
points, rules, but learn from life

241
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,740
how exactly the card is combined

242
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,900
with your reality, because we are all

243
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,320
different people. You cannot tell

244
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,990
and give the same interpretation

245
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,510
to the different people. That is, you

246
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,580
need to understand what a person does, what

247
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,040
he lives. If a person is engaged in, say, some

248
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,230
magical practices, then let's say

249
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,070
the Chariot of Hermes is one thing.

250
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,010
For him. Or the Devil. Devil card.

251
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,040
This is one thing. And if you are an ordinary person

252
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,930
who is, say, a middle-level

253
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,900
manager, an office worker, then this is

254
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,660
different. That is, a completely different

255
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,630
interpretation. Therefore, when you enter the

256
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,850
flow, it begins to work and interact

257
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,770
with you exactly at your level, and

258
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,020
you must understand this and you

259
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,600
must see how it works, how this card

260
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,450
works in your life. The next very

261
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,610
important question: they always ask how to

262
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,120
understand that the cards are really connected to this

263
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
infernal stream, that you receive information

264
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,010
from above, and not just a

265
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,070
logical analysis takes place?

266
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,250
Indeed, the cards have different levels.

267
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,380
The first, primary, level is

268
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,800
meditation. This is when each card

269
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,769
is interpreted by you based on your life.

270
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,290
That is, they give you the opportunity to

271
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,450
simply meditate. That is, you made

272
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,240
the spread and became thoughtful, concentrated,

273
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,760
created a certain focus on some

274
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,950
problem, and you sit and meditate.

275
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,800
This is really such a brainstorming, this is

276
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,810
analysis, this is meditation - whatever you want

277
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,380
to call it. This is the usual level

278
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,380
of people who do this. And there is the next

279
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,019
level - this is when you are already included

280
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,420
in streams, in infernal streams, and

281
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,970
information comes from above. How do you know that

282
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,390
you are not meditating? This is when almost

283
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,730
the same cards

284
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,170
or similar cards fall on the

285
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,010
same situation, and

286
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,711
the situation constantly looms

287
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:21,760
the same.

288
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,050
This happened to me all

289
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,910
the time. Let's say, before

290
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,100
my trip to Dubai, I told on

291
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,980
my second YouTube channel "Meta Senses"

292
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,519
that it showed up as "bad",

293
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,602
"destruction", "negative",

294
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:36,709
and so on, and so on.

295
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,670
Indeed, just before the trip in the evening,

296
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,130
a message comes in that our booking has

297
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,620
been canceled, and we have to fly in

298
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,800
the morning. These are the moments. And before

299
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,430
that, three or four times, five times, it directly

300
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,860
showed up the "negative", "destruction" and

301
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,950
so on, so on, "transformation", such kind of moments.

302
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,529
This already suggests that the cards

303
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,930
communicate with you. This is

304
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,940
already a connection. This is not just meditation,

305
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,079
but it is connecting to a completely different level.

306
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,339
The next point that I would like to mention

307
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,940
is probably

308
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,800
also an important point: you will notice

309
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,290
that when you start working with

310
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,089
this tool, very often all the negative

311
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,660
things show up. I remember when I

312
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,029
took lessons from one sorceress on these

313
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,070
cards, she said: "If they come to you, tell

314
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,160
the tale of the golden cockerel."

315
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,980
This is her clear expression. That is, do

316
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,459
not usually tell people any negativity.

317
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,930
Why? Because you make money,

318
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,329
or you will make money, and you

319
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,279
don't need people to leave

320
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,280
you in a bad mood. Here is such an

321
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,250
approach, such a moment, why cards very

322
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,560
often tell you about negative events.

323
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,170
Because if you come and ask some

324
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,810
person to make a reading for you, for

325
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,970
example, some sort of analysis, then you

326
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,920
already have a problem, that is, you are

327
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,900
already in the negative zone.

328
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,040
Is it logical? It is logical! If, for example, you live well,

329
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,470
you do not need anything, then you will not

330
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,630
even think to go to someone and do some

331
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,270
sort of analysis. Is it logical? It is logical!

332
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,310
Therefore, the cards show some kind of

333
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,970
negative. This is the first thing. The second point: in general,

334
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,820
a person who did not get on his own path,

335
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,810
did not get on his way, as a rule,

336
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,180
will always bang at some walls, at

337
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,550
some problems, until he follows the glow of

338
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,040
his eun, according to the "metasensitive" system. ...

339
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Until he gets on his

340
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,980
way, until he is identical

341
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,170
with his own ātman, nothing

342
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,760
good will happen to him.

343
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,830
These will be bumps, bumps, bumps

344
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,710
and everything else.

345
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,210
Therefore, there

346
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,420
is no need to be surprised at anything either.

347
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,680
The next point: can cards

348
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,780
really suggest a way out of the

349
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,970
situation? Yes, they can, but, as a rule,

350
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,240
I noticed such a thing that the cards almost

351
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,900
do not change their answer. You can

352
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,480
divinate one, two, three times - all the time

353
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,520
it will be the same, until you develop

354
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,310
some skill in

355
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,470
your character. I noticed such

356
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,390
a thing that only if you go through some life

357
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,360
path and change internally,

358
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,930
the cards really

359
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,730
begin to respond in a different way.

360
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,030
The nature of your

361
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,470
relationship, contact with life, changes

362
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,600
your internal component and,

363
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,850
accordingly, the information in the

364
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,740
readings changes, that is, from negative

365
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,240
to some more positive, or the

366
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,570
situation is transformed.

367
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,760
The next question: is it possible, as they say

368
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,920
in simple language, to divinate and break the

369
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,410
situation? Let's say something

370
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,360
good is about to happen, and you divinate

371
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,500
and end up breaking it?

372
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,330
There are such moments, but, as a rule, as I

373
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,030
noticed,

374
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,670
for the most part if this is some kind

375
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,740
of powerful global process, then you will

376
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,000
not break anything. There are times

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,730
when you just readjust a little

378
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,580
differently. But this is understandable - even if

379
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,610
you begin to meditate on a certain situation,

380
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,100
then, entering with

381
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,020
your attention into some problem, you are

382
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,540
already changing this problem. You change yourself,

383
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,700
your attitude to this situation;

384
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,620
accordingly, everything changes. Therefore,

385
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,230
it very often happens that after some analysis,

386
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,480
after the alignment, if a person with his

387
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,370
attention has entered very deeply into the

388
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,650
situation, he has changed his attitude to

389
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,840
this situation. Accordingly, the situation

390
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,850
has already changed, and it may not

391
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,080
even happen. Is it clear? That's the whole point.

392
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,240
Once upon a time when I was in

393
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,300
Atlanta (Georgia) , I made a video

394
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,090
about it and told this situation:

395
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,310
why the great prophets, say,

396
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,930
some Nostradamus and so on, encrypted

397
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,720
everything. Because if people

398
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,990
enter a situation with their attention,

399
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,200
they redirect their choice of movement, and,

400
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,370
accordingly, it is very difficult to prove

401
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,660
that you are a professional,

402
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,970
because it turns out that you are lying.

403
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,010
Well, let's say you came up with some problem

404
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,710
of your own, very, very powerful, which presses

405
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,610
on you. Let's say I do you a reading,

406
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,160
tell you about it. You are diving very

407
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,050
powerfully, very strongly. This should be a

408
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,990
deep dive, and you remove this

409
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,790
problem because you change your attitude,

410
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,040
you find some completely different

411
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,260
keys to its solution, and the whole

412
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,380
situation changes completely, that is, you

413
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,540
switch to other rails, and then it turns out:

414
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,580
what the cards told you about,

415
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,350
this is no longer coming true, this is

416
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,540
no longer relevant. It turns out that

417
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,280
the person who makes the reading for you is a

418
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,060
liar. Because in this life, you see, you

419
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,090
have to go along some path, you have to

420
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,030
get your sensations, but these

421
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,880
sensations can occur through

422
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,700
some different moments. Do you understand? You

423
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,190
can learn something as a full

424
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,620
beggar, but you can learn the

425
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,710
same thing as a rich person. Pain,

426
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,020
suffering, and so on. But it all depends on

427
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,300
you, what kind of decorations will be around you.

428
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,210
Therefore, there are such effects

429
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,120
when really very strong tarologists

430
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,580
make the very powerful readings,

431
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,680
you plunge very deeply and then

432
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,510
nothing happens. This is because you

433
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,390
have changed. He just transformed you.

434
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,660
He reprogrammed you.

435
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,000
During the reading, during the analysis, he

436
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,300
reprogrammed you. And the more powerful a person

437
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
is in his awareness, the ability to

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,290
give information, the more powerful he

439
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,630
can reflash you.

440
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,340
Here's the thing. And if he

441
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,770
reprogrammed you, then this does

442
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,350
not happen the way these cards

443
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,770
showed. That is, you disclaim

444
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,720
your choice and you redirect your

445
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,140
movement. Therefore, it is very difficult

446
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,660
to track any statistics here, as I

447
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,670
explained to you. That is why many people say:

448
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,604
"This is quackery!",

449
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:14,652
"It doesn't work at all!",

450
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,933
"This is just some kind of analysis! ",

451
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,912
and so on and so forth.

452
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,890
Because we are alive, we

453
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,710
are a live stream, guys. We are a living stream,

454
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,480
we are changing, we can change our

455
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,490
attitude. Look at your life.

456
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,610
For example, you want to buy a house somewhere

457
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,490
and right here you are already

458
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,440
sure that it is in this area, in this city,

459
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,660
that you want a house, an apartment.

460
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,620
Then you gain experience, your attention switches

461
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,380
from this place away, and you suddenly discover

462
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,060
a completely different place for yourself,

463
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,990
and you no longer want that. Clear?

464
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,450
That is, the goal of buying a house remains,

465
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,690
but the place where you wanted this has already changed.

466
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,580
That is, the scenery changed a little, but

467
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,980
the goal itself remained.

468
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,930
And there are a lot of such moments

469
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,270
in your life. If you come and

470
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,100
say: “I want to buy a house

471
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,290
in the Rostov region. Will I buy?

472
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,140
"And the cards show you what problems there will

473
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,360
be, what moments there will be, and so on, and

474
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,150
you suddenly changed your minds and, for example, in

475
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,009
the Samara region - you saw that there is a

476
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:22,340
wonderful house there. Does this mean that about

477
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,740
the Rostov region, about the house in the Rostov

478
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,929
region, where the cards said that you will buy a

479
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,379
house, that this is a lie? Of course not. You just

480
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:33,799
changed. Therefore, here, when you ask

481
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,240
questions and analyze, you must ask yourself

482
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,519
very clearly about the details

483
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,230
of your inner state, about the feelings

484
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,720
of your inner, without

485
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,370
detailing. When you

486
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,590
start to detail, you narrow

487
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,070
the spectrum of your attention,

488
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,720
and the more detail, the more

489
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,210
subtle it is, like a needle that can

490
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,759
be broken very quickly. So here you have

491
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,850
to either ask in general, “Will

492
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,309
I buy a house? ", this is in the example with

493
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,970
a house, and there will

494
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,769
be no Rostov, Samara region, or something

495
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,299
else, and you will get some kind of

496
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:18,980
answer that really correlates with some

497
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,279
moments, or, if you are detailing, then

498
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,740
you must understand  that this is one of

499
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,549
the options that the cards showed you.

500
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,289
It is quite possible, if this is a negative

501
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,559
alignment, a negative

502
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,179
interpretation, after this meditation

503
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:38,860
you took and changed your attitude.

504
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,509
That is, I have explained these basic

505
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,299
points.

506
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,529
The next question, which is very often

507
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:49,039
asked: "What is better - to work with

508
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,529
runes, cards, or

509
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,480
numerology?" In numerology, I have

510
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,070
a private stream. I have my own system

511
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,950
of contact, entry into numerology.

512
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,100
I gave this practice.

513
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,929
You can very powerfully read

514
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,850
information about what is happening to you now,

515
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,299
how it is happening, and so on.

516
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,889
Here you need to look if there is a contact,

517
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:17,230
if the same information is given.

518
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,809
If you once made the reading and got one

519
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,292
information, the second - another information,

520
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:24,213
the third - the third information, if

521
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,439
there is no certain constancy, then

522
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:28,450
this structure does not

523
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,330
work for you. That is, you should see the constancy

524
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,669
that you are asking about something,

525
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:35,799
and here it says the same

526
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,480
thing: either good or negative, and not

527
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,950
so that one reading shows up one thing, another

528
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:43,634
reading shows up another, the

529
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,469
third shows the third,

530
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:45,613
the fourth shows the fourth.

531
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:46,570
That is, if

532
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,539
we make reading on some powerful problem.

533
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,639
In this part, I have now

534
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:58,899
explained to you the approach to this

535
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,510
system: how to work, how to interact,

536
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,929
how to open this world. Perhaps now I would

537
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:07,809
like to touch upon one more point.

538
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,669
In Christian culture, it is said that

539
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:13,260
divination is a sin.

540
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,840
You know, I recently ran into one

541
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,059
person. Smart enough, cardiologist.

542
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:21,880
He said that meditation is also a sin.

543
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,010
When I asked him, what is the

544
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,529
sinfulness of meditation? He says -

545
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,410
through meditation you cognize

546
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,010
yourself as God and subsequently deny

547
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,800
God himself.

548
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,300
That is, we must understand that any

549
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,030
religion

550
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,150
has an attitude that you should, well,

551
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,730
let's say, let go of the situation,

552
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,840
try not to control it and try

553
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,510
to trust the God. Trust the God.

554
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,000
This is the main goal. Why divination

555
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,010
or meditation or something

556
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,770
else is interpreted

557
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,820
by religious confessions as something

558
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,950
sinful? Because you do not seem to trust

559
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,800
God and you yourself

560
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,450
are intruding into some processes,

561
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,220
trying to understand them, trying

562
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,110
to feel them, and so on. This is, as

563
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,180
it were, sinfulness. But in my opinion, a

564
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,670
person is a true believer, believes

565
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,330
in God. He believes.

566
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,370
And no meditation, no cards,

567
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,970
no readings, no analyzes will

568
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,270
break a person in his faith. If a person

569
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,520
does not have this faith, if he was

570
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,340
originally with some kind of

571
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,300
exclusivity within himself, then this was

572
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,360
before the cards, and before some meditations.

573
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,160
He was simply not looking for God, he was

574
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,827
looking for confirmation of his super-exclusiveness.

575
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:52,510
Understand?

576
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,040
But here again, you know, a conversation

577
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,080
about the weakness of people, that a

578
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,700
strong person will really understand that no

579
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,760
matter what he does, he does in God, and

580
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,130
a weak person can really start doing

581
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,960
something, he will succeed, and there already

582
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,240
such a crown grows, and there is such

583
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,150
a person who is just super-powerful, super-strong,

584
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,690
who already thinks: “I predict

585
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,310
the future! Ahaaa!“ You know, something like

586
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,980
this is happening, and there you already look

587
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,200
at a person - he has a face like a

588
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,590
rutabaga, he sits all puffed up like that, there are

589
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,130
some candles burning, smoking. Well,

590
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,327
probably, for the most part,

591
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,193
this is the whole thing.

592
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:35,200
And of course, this person already

593
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,870
needs a reboot in order to leave, to

594
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,950
come back here, it’s somehow easier to

595
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,230
take this to everything, and

596
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,480
start interacting. Therefore, choose the

597
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,740
system that is

598
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,750
constant in your answers.

599
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,930
For me, this is this criterion. There

600
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,210
is no constancy in the answers to some

601
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,940
problematic - you already understand that this

602
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,090
is not your system. Likewise,

603
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,820
the pendulum is the same. If you work with

604
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,460
a pendulum, once asked - it answered "yes",

605
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,740
the second time you ask - "no", the third

606
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,560
time you ask - "yes", and off you go

607
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,420
- there is no certainty. The pendulum is

608
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,700
also checked by the fact that it must answer the

609
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,380
same problem in the same way.

610
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,074
The next point, which

611
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:25,393
I would also like to touch

612
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,111
upon in our opening

613
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:29,430
monologue, is the point

614
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,840
that it is not a man's business to get

615
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,440
into all these matters, that it is mainly

616
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,340
women who are engaged in this, and so on.

617
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,140
You know, friends, the most powerful

618
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,900
magicians and mystics are just men. If you

619
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,660
look at who did most of this -

620
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,200
there is John Dee,

621
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,100
Crowley, Papus and

622
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,940
Gurdjieff - who they are,

623
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,270
then most of them are men. They

624
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,060
have more powerful contact, more powerful,

625
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,430
more open. I was just recently in

626
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,380
Puerto Rico, and we were talking, and the

627
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,060
person who was with me said to me: "You are

628
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,690
brujo", well, they have a magician there. And they

629
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,940
have a brujo there, el brujo, somehow they call him, I

630
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,640
don't know much, and they think in

631
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,590
the Latin world that a woman is

632
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,640
weaker, that a male magician, brujo, he

633
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
is stronger than a woman. Although, for

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
women, for example, the problems that they solve on

635
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,380
the female line, they do, of course,

636
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,240
better, because they understand what is

637
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,700
at stake in general - something that

638
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,830
a man cannot always

639
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,990
understand. That is, I just retell

640
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,489
the communication

641
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,989
with the people who were there,

642
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,179
and when we were in Puerto Rico, we met

643
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,089
there with a couple of people who practice

644
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:55,669
something there, and everyone repeated

645
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,919
that "el brujo, brujo". A woman

646
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,289
who is engaged is like this, a man is

647
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,779
like this. Serious problems - you go to a

648
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,749
man, with the simpler ones, with your family,

649
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:08,269
with children - you go to a woman. Here

650
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:10,519
are some such moments. Why it

651
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,909
happens? Well, because the world is so arranged that

652
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:15,009
men,

653
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:18,199
they are in isolation, they are closer to the sky,

654
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:21,739
and a woman, she is closer to the earth, to the moon,

655
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:23,979
to such kind of things.

656
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:27,709
There is nothing wrong with that, but this

657
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,989
is how it turns out. Therefore, the expression

658
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:33,019
that this is not a man's business,

659
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,449
well, it needs to be looked at,

660
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:38,359
but who did it all, who created this deck

661
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,109
of cards, who Crowley is, who are they

662
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:44,029
in general, what kind of people

663
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:46,940
they are. Are they women? And of course,

664
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,789
for example, Crowley had a faithful companion,

665
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:53,029
and so all the powerful mystics had,

666
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:56,329
Salvador Dali - his Gala. All

667
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,849
powerful mystics, as a rule, have a woman

668
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:02,089
nearby. Like Lenin - Krupskaya,

669
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:05,359
Salvador Dali had his Gala, Crowley had

670
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,509
a life friend there too, who made a very,

671
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,629
very powerful contribution. Suppose the

672
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:14,679
same deck of cards was drawn by a

673
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,449
woman, his close associate, friend,

674
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,669
comrade, and so on, who supported

675
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:21,649
him all the time. This is how it is in

676
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:22,959
this reality.

677
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,419
Although, probably,

678
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,440
feminist-minded people will think about

679
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,379
it now, and you have a chance to create your own

680
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:32,779
deck of cards, purely female. Although,

681
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,599
I remember when I was in New Orleans,

682
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,239
there was a very powerful witch. I have now

683
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,609
forgotten her last name. I even visited her

684
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:44,839
grave. Very powerful. There, she

685
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,729
worked with voodoo, and so on - she has

686
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:49,129
her own....... Marie somehow, I don't remember her

687
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:50,590
name. Write in

688
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,710
the comments. Marie....... Marie, that's it.

689
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,620
Marie....... I even did a video of her living in her

690
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,064
house in New Orleans. (Marie Laveau)...

691
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:58,870
Well, she still has

692
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,990
her own deck of cards, whatever

693
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,659
one may say. After all, all this

694
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,870
also exists. But this is just a joke. That was

695
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,390
my little introduction. If you

696
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,240
support this undertaking, we will

697
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,549
continue to talk with you on specifics, on

698
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:17,409
cards, on explanations,

699
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,809
on contacts with life, with situations,

700
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,491
with everything else.

701
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,620
How it interacts, what does

702
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,169
it interact with, what reactions are

703
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,080
going on, and everything else. In general,

704
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,690
friends, I want to remind you once again: this

705
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,980
is my second YouTube channel,

706
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,539
it is called "metasensitive". My main

707
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:39,669
YouTube channel is called "Meta

708
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:42,460
Senses", so look for me there. There

709
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,429
is also a Telegram channel, which is

710
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:48,399
also called "metasensitive". There is also

711
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
Instagram and a group on VK "Creaky

712
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,260
door". Group on VK "Creaky door". So

713
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,529
join please. I, quite possibly, in

714
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,480
the group on VK "Creaky door" will

715
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,809
make a post with questions about tarot

716
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:04,419
cards and, if you write, I will then disclose

717
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:07,059
the topic in such online sites.

718
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,860
And once again I want to add again: I recently

719
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,559
made a

720
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,529
stream called "Brujo", where I talked about

721
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,049
the moment of feedback, why

722
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:22,149
some people do not have this, it does

723
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,880
not work, I just wrote my insights.

724
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,100
Take a look. Be sure

725
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,110
to watch this previous stream,

726
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,480
which is now publicly available on my

727
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,580
channel.

728
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,809
Think because the feedback is very,

729
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,750
very, very important. Moreover, if

730
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,529
you take something, there must be a balance.

731
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:44,799
You cannot learn anything without giving anything

732
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,960
in return.

733
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,570
This must be understood. Thanks to all. Bye!

734
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,240
I will wait for your reaction. Goodbye.

735
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,049
Many thanks.
